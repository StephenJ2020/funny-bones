                <p class="end-text"> It’s you! Thank goodness for that - I thought I was going to be stuck up there
                    forever! </p>
                <p>I’m sure you have lots of questions… let me explain… the other night I was at home minding my own
                    business when there was a knock on the door. </p>
                <p>I wasn’t expecting anyone so I thought it must’ve been some
                    trick or treaters being the 31st of October. I opened the door to see a woman dressed in the most
                    wonderful witch costume! </p>
                <p> A great big wide-brimmed witches hat, a long crooked nose, it must have
                    been a prosthetic but it looked as real as anything, and a long black dress with the most amazing
                    embroidery and black silk.</p>
                <p>I admitted that I had completely forgotten to get out to the shops that
                    afternoon so had nothing to offer her. </p>
                <p>She looked at me and said in the most chilling high-pitched
                    voice “Well, it will have to be trick in that case…”. All of a sudden I felt my knees go weak and
                    saw bright lights in my eyes.</p>
                <p>The next thing I knew I was here, I could hear the neighbours
                    downstairs calling my name but as loud as I shouted they couldn’t hear a word I said. It seems I
                    must have been enchanted in some way but you managed to break the spell!</p>
                <p>Help me down these stairs my dear and I’ll put the kettle on…how have you been? How is your job in the city?
                </p>
                <p class="end-p">…THE END</p>
