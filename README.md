## Scope  
------  
* To create a user friendly and simple to use interactive story book app using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap. 
* Intuitive design: allow users to navigate the site intuitively, play games and learn the stories.

  
## Structure  
------  
The app consists of 5 pages in total.

### The Game Pages
3 of the pages are "game" pages, that is, they each display a different type of simple game.  
The 3 games that we have decided on are as follows:  
#### A Maze Game  
The user is asked to guide their pointer through a "maze" in order to get to the middle within a given time period.
#### Smashing Pumpkins Game
Inspired by whac-a-mole, the user must click on the disappearing pumpkin heads before the time runs out.
#### Night Invaders Game  
Inspired by space invaders, the user must avoid the scary bats whilst killing a certain amount in a given time.

### The Landing Page
The main page that displays the picture of the haunted house and contains various pop-ups and modals to tell the story and provide interactivity.

### The Final Page
Similar to the main page this would contain pop-ups and scrollable text and would be set against a picture of an attic as this is where the story ends.

### Notes  
The main page is the first page the user will come across.  The user then has the option to naviage to any of the 3 "Game Pages".  Once they have completed this
they will be able to access the final page to finish the story.




The app consists of the landing page with the game instructions and a 'Play Now' button, three game pages, that allow users to unlock the story endings by winning the games and the 'Play Again' page.

### Color Scheme  

![color palette](assets/images/color-palette.png)  
To create the color palette we used [Coolors](https://coolors.co/).

Hues of orange, purple and black were chosen for this project as they are traditional colors of Halloween. Combination of these colors are warm and stimulating and grab children's attention.

### Typography

* Google Fonts _*Griffy*_ and _*Creepster*_ were used accross the site for a fayrytale look and feel with a touch of spooky just to give you the creeps.
